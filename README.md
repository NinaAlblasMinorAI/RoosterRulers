# Rooster Rulers' Project: the Perfect Schedule

In this case, a week schedule is created for a list of courses on UvA Science Park.
- Courses consist of lectures and/or tutorials and/or labs. There is a maximum number of students defined for each tutorial and lab.
- There are seven rooms of varying capacities, and each room is suited to host lectures, tutorials, as well as labs.
- All lectures, tutorials, and labs need to be placed in a time slot. The available time slots are 09:00-11:00, 11:00-13:00, 13:00-15:00, or 15:00-17:00, from Monday to Friday. The largest room (C0.110) also has an evening slot (17:00-19:00). This makes for a total of 145 available room-time slots.
- A week schedule is valid when all lectures, tutorials, and labs (i.e., "lessons") are assigned a room-time slot.
- A room-time slot can only be used for one lesson at a time.
- Each student has an individual schedule.
The goal is to create a schedule in which students fit into the rooms they are placed in as often as possible, and in which the number of evening slots, lesson conflicts, and free periods is minimized.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This codebase was completely written in [Python3.8.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/). In requirements.txt the user can find all the required packages to succesfully run the code. These are easily installed through pip using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Structure

The files are divided into the following folders:
- code: all Python scripts, including the following subfolders:
    - algorithms
    - classes
    - trash
    - visualization

- doc: documents, e.g. presentations
- input_data: the input data for the case, e.g. the .csv file with the courses
- output_data: the output data generated by the scripts


### Testing

Use the command below to run the code. For distributing the lessons over the schedule, the user can choose from the 'random', 'hillclimber', and 'simulated_annealing' algorithm. For distributing the students over the lessons, the 'hillclimber' algorithm is always used, so this does not need to be specified.

```
python main.py <algorithm>
```

Following command line arguments are available:
- -n -> total number of runs for the algorithm
- -O -> number of optimize runs using extra lessons
- -c -> number of extra lessons to create per optimize run
- -r -> number of repeats for redistributing lessons; for 'hillclimber', it is the number of iterations that the objective value does not change before the algorithm stops, for 'simulated annealing', it is the total number of iterations.
- -o -> number of outer repeats for redistributing students; the number of iterations that all non-lecture lessons of the same type from a single course are selected and the objective value does not change before the algorithm stops 
- -i -> number of inner repeats for redistributing students; the number of iterations that two students are selected and the objective value does not change before the algorithm stops
- -t -> starting temperature for 'simulated annealing'
- -v -> verbose; boolean that indicates extra logging on the command prompt
